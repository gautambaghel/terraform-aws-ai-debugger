## Prerequisites

To use this module you need have the following:

1. AWS account and credentials
1. HCP Terraform account

## Usage

1. Reference the `examples/basic` folder on how to use this module

    ```sh
    cd examples/basic
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Best practice

* **Do not** re-use the the endpoint URL across different trust-boundary (organizations, accounts, team). We recommend you to deploy separate the AI debugger deployment per trust-boundary.

* **Do not** use AI debugger URL from untrusted party, remember that execution is sent HCP Terraform to the AI debugger endpoint. Only use trusted URLs.

* Enable the AWS WAF setup by setting variable `deploy_waf` to `true` (additional cost will apply). This will add WAF protection to the AI debugger URL endpoint.

* We recommend you to setup additional CloudWatch alarm to monitor Lambda concurrency and WAF rules.
